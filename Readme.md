Hr Music Calendar - BlackBerry PlayBook demo application
========================================

This application is a product made for the BlackBerry PlayBook application development contest. It's based on Flex mobile application framework from Adobe. 

The application provides a list of music events going on in Croatia for the following week. Event information are provided by the [Muzika.hr](http://www.muzika.hr/) portal through the API, protected with the API key for accessing the data. Application code is published just for learning and reference purposes, and is highly recommended for you to find or build your own JSON data source to pull the data from.

If you'd really want to test out the application working, you may contact me for a temporary API key. Can't promise quick response, or even granting the key, it really depends on the free time I'll have at that moment, or the current data access policy in place.
